Rustle Search Frontend Using Tauri

This is just a (not so) small side project that i started so i could learn more about how search engines work and how to make web crawlers and stuff. the search engine uses 2 main csv files, `websites.csv` and `inverted_index.csv`, both of which were generated by the rustle data collecter/web scraper available [here](https://github.com/rip-super/rustle-scraper)
